Abstract = {Rapid technological breakthroughs in recent years, like Deepfake, have
   made it feasible to produce synthetic media that is remarkably lifelike,
   but they also present significant hazards to public trust, privacy, and
   security. This survey paper reviews the latest techniques for detecting
   deepfakes, focussing on important components as image and video
   manipulation, audio spoofing, and multimodal synthesis. It features
   state-of-the-art methods including machine learning (ML), deep learning
   (DL), and multimodal architectures that are especially made to address
   the previously described deepfake criteria. The report provides a
   critical review of assessment measures used to assess detection model
   performance, including precision, accuracy, recall, computing
   effectiveness and efficiency, and fast responses to adversarial attacks.
   In order to assist direct future research, this highlights recent
   advancements in the subject, including explainable AI, federated
   learning, and self-supervised learning hierarchy. In order to examine
   the problems with adversarial attacks, scalability across different
   datasets, and the ethical implications of detection techniques, it is
   also vital to look into the technological and societal challenges
   surrounding multimedia-enabled deepfake detection. In particular, the
   usage of Blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (BDLT) for
   traceability, lightweight modelling, and resilient systems forms for
   cross-model deepfake evaluation are discussed in this review study along
   with potential solutions to these limitations and areas for further
   research. This paper offers a comprehensive resource for future
   research, experts, and practitioners looking to combat the growing
   threat of deepfake, especially in the social media space, using
   innovative and useful detection tools.},
