	abstract = {Deepfake technology, enabled by generative adversarial networks, creates fake video content with significant societal impacts, such as electoral bias and celebrity defamation. This research aims to develop an automatic and effective facial tampering detection model for videos, regardless of their quality. The proposed two-fold approach enhances facial frame features using image aggregation and detects feature anomalies through a neural network with convolutions and fully connected layers. The paper introduces image frame quality enhancement and different activation functions to improve performance, achieving up to 98% accuracy with the hybrid model. Additionally, the work explores the detection of deep fakes in low-quality frames by reducing frame quality by 20% and 50%. The hybrid model achieves an accuracy of up to 96% in the first suboptimal condition and up to 93.7% in the second quality reduction condition. This research presents a promising method for deepfake detection, with the potential to mitigate its negative social impact. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.},
